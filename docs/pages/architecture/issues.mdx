# Issues

Issues capture problems in your application — exceptions, panics, and explicitly sent messages.

## What Creates an Issue

An issue is created when:

- A **panic** occurs during a traced request or task
- An **error** is passed to `c.Error()` in Gin
- Your code explicitly calls `CaptureException`, `CaptureMessage`, or related functions

## Errors vs Messages

Traceway captures two kinds of issues:

- **Errors** — Runtime exceptions with stack traces (panics, captured errors)
- **Messages** — Explicitly captured strings via `CaptureMessage("something happened")`

Both appear in the Issues list with full context and attributes.

## Connection to Traces

Issues can be **linked to a trace** via context. When an exception occurs during an HTTP request or background task, the trace ID is automatically attached to the issue.

This linkage means:

- Viewing an issue shows which endpoint or task triggered it
- Viewing a trace shows any issues that occurred during execution
- Attributes from the trace context are included in the issue

Issues captured outside of a trace context (no active request or task) are recorded as standalone issues without a trace link.

## Automatic Grouping

Traceway groups similar exceptions into a single issue by normalizing stack traces:

- Variable values (user IDs, timestamps) are replaced with placeholders
- Memory addresses and file paths are normalized
- UUIDs, IP addresses, and numeric IDs are generalized
- A hash is generated from the normalized trace

This means the same bug produces one issue, not thousands of duplicates with different runtime data.

## Issue Lifecycle

1. **Active** — When an issue first occurs
2. **Archived** — Marked as resolved by you (hidden from the default view)
3. **Reopened** — An archived issue that occurred again (regression detected)

## Attributes on Issues

Issues carry their own attributes — the key-value metadata that was in scope when the exception occurred. If the issue is linked to a trace, it inherits the trace's attributes.

When error recording flags are enabled in middleware, additional context is attached:

- Request URL
- Query parameters
- Request body (JSON only, max 64KB)
- Request headers
