# Spans

Spans are timed sub-operations within a trace. They show where time is spent during request processing or background task execution.

## What Spans Capture

Each span records:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| ID | Unique span identifier |
| Name | Descriptive name you provide |
| Start Time | When the span started |
| Duration | Time elapsed (calculated on `End()`) |

## Use Cases

Spans are useful for timing:

- Database queries
- External API calls
- Cache operations
- File I/O
- Business logic steps

## Viewing Spans

In the dashboard:

1. Navigate to the **Endpoints** or **Tasks** page
2. Click on an entry to see its details
3. Individual traces show their spans as a timeline
4. Each span displays its name and duration

This helps identify bottlenecks — if a request takes 500ms and 450ms is in a database span, you know where to optimize.

## Naming Conventions

Use hierarchical, descriptive names for easy filtering:

```
db.users.find
db.orders.insert
api.stripe.charge
api.sendgrid.send
cache.redis.get
logic.pricing.calculate
```

The pattern `category.resource.action` keeps span names consistent and searchable across your codebase.

## Nesting

Spans can be nested for hierarchical tracking. The parent span encompasses the child spans:

```
Total: 200ms
├── process.checkout: 200ms
│   ├── process.checkout.validate: 20ms
│   ├── process.checkout.charge: 150ms
│   └── process.checkout.fulfill: 30ms
```

Nesting is achieved by starting child spans before ending the parent span. All spans are attached to the same trace context.
