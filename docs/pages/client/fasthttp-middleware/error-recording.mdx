# FastHTTP Error Recording

When an exception occurs during a request, you can control what additional request data is captured alongside the stack trace.

## Recording Flags

Configure error recording with `WithOnErrorRecording`:

```go
tracewayfasthttp.New(
    connectionString,
    tracewayfasthttp.WithOnErrorRecording(
        tracewayfasthttp.RecordingUrl | tracewayfasthttp.RecordingQuery,
    ),
)
```

### Available Flags

| Flag | Description | Privacy Impact |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| `RecordingUrl` | Request URL path | Low |
| `RecordingQuery` | Query parameters as JSON | Medium |
| `RecordingBody` | Request body (JSON content-type only, max 64KB) | High |
| `RecordingHeader` | Request headers as JSON | High |

### Combining Flags

Flags are combined with the `|` operator:

```go
// Record URL and query parameters
tracewayfasthttp.RecordingUrl | tracewayfasthttp.RecordingQuery

// Record everything
tracewayfasthttp.RecordingUrl | tracewayfasthttp.RecordingQuery | tracewayfasthttp.RecordingBody | tracewayfasthttp.RecordingHeader
```

## Body Capture Details

Body recording has two constraints:

- **Content-Type must be `application/json`** — non-JSON bodies are not captured
- **Maximum size is 64KB** — bodies larger than 64KB are truncated

After reading the body for capture, it is restored so downstream handlers can still read it.

## Privacy Considerations

Body and header recording may capture sensitive data:

- Authentication tokens in headers
- Personal information in request bodies
- API keys in query parameters

Use minimal recording flags in production:

```go
// Production — limited data
tracewayfasthttp.WithOnErrorRecording(
    tracewayfasthttp.RecordingUrl | tracewayfasthttp.RecordingQuery,
)

// Development — full request data
tracewayfasthttp.WithOnErrorRecording(
    tracewayfasthttp.RecordingUrl |
    tracewayfasthttp.RecordingQuery |
    tracewayfasthttp.RecordingBody |
    tracewayfasthttp.RecordingHeader,
)
```

## Captured Data Format

Recorded data is attached as attributes on the issue:

| Attribute Key | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| `url` | URL path string |
| `query` | JSON-encoded query parameters |
| `body` | Raw request body string |
| `headers` | JSON-encoded request headers |
| `user agent` | User-Agent header value (always captured on error) |
