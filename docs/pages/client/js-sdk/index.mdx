# JS SDK Overview

The Traceway JavaScript SDK provides error tracking for browser-based applications. It captures exceptions, messages, and sends them to your Traceway backend.

## Packages

| Package | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `@traceway/frontend` | Core browser SDK (framework-agnostic) |
| `@traceway/react` | React bindings with Provider, Error Boundary, and hooks |
| `@traceway/vue` | Vue 3 plugin and composables |
| `@traceway/svelte` | Svelte context-based integration |

## Installation

```bash
npm install @traceway/frontend
```

Or use a framework-specific package:

```bash
npm install @traceway/react
npm install @traceway/vue
npm install @traceway/svelte
```

## Connection String Format

All Traceway SDKs use a connection string to identify your project and endpoint:

```
<project_token>@<server_url>/api/report
```

Example:
```
abc123def456@https://traceway.example.com/api/report
```

You can find your connection string in the Traceway dashboard under **Project Settings**.

## When to Use

Use the generic `@traceway/frontend` package when:

- You're using a framework without official bindings
- You need direct control over initialization
- You're building a vanilla JavaScript application
- You want to integrate with a custom framework

For React, Vue, or Svelte applications, use the framework-specific packages for better integration and developer experience.

## Basic Usage

```javascript
import { init, captureException, captureMessage } from "@traceway/frontend";

// Initialize once at app startup
init("your-token@https://traceway.example.com/api/report");

// Capture errors
try {
  riskyOperation();
} catch (error) {
  captureException(error);
}

// Capture custom messages
captureMessage("User completed checkout");
```

## Features

- **Automatic batching**: Events are batched and sent periodically to reduce network overhead
- **Retry with backoff**: Failed uploads are automatically retried
- **Stack trace capture**: Full stack traces are captured for exceptions
- **Custom attributes**: Attach metadata to exceptions for better debugging
- **Lightweight**: Minimal bundle size impact
