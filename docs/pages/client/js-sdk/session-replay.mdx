# Session Replay

Session Replay records DOM changes and user interactions in the browser, then attaches the recording to captured exceptions. This lets you see exactly what happened leading up to an error.

## How It Works

Session Replay uses [rrweb](https://github.com/rrweb-io/rrweb) to record the DOM. Recordings are split into segments that rotate on a fixed interval. When an exception is captured, all current segments are attached to it and sent to Traceway.

Recordings appear on the exception detail page in the Traceway dashboard as a **Session Replay** card.

## Enabled by Default

Session Replay is enabled by default when using `@tracewayapp/frontend` in a browser environment. No additional configuration is needed.

```javascript
import { init } from "@tracewayapp/frontend";

// Session Replay is active
init("your-token@https://traceway.example.com/api/report");
```

## Disabling Session Replay

```javascript
import { init } from "@tracewayapp/frontend";

init("your-token@https://traceway.example.com/api/report", {
  sessionRecording: false,
});
```

## Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `sessionRecording` | `boolean` | `true` | Enable or disable session recording |
| `sessionRecordingSegmentDuration` | `number` | `10000` | Duration of each recording segment in milliseconds |

## Segment Rotation

Recordings are split into segments to limit memory usage. Every 10 seconds (by default), the current segment is finalized and a new one begins with a fresh DOM snapshot.

You can adjust the segment duration:

```javascript
init("your-token@https://traceway.example.com/api/report", {
  sessionRecordingSegmentDuration: 30000, // 30 seconds per segment
});
```

## Viewing Recordings

When an exception includes session recording data, a **Session Replay** card appears on the exception detail page in the Traceway dashboard. The replay shows DOM state and user interactions leading up to the error.
