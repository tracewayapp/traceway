# Messages

Messages are explicitly captured strings that appear as issues in the dashboard. Unlike exceptions, messages don't carry automatic stack traces — they record whatever string you provide.

## CaptureMessage

Capture a standalone message:

```go
traceway.CaptureMessage("User exceeded rate limit")
```

This creates an issue with no trace link and no attributes beyond the message itself.

## CaptureMessageWithContext

Capture a message with trace linkage and attributes from the Go context:

```go
func handler(c *gin.Context) {
    ctx := c.Request.Context()

    if user.RequestCount > rateLimit {
        traceway.CaptureMessageWithContext(ctx, "Rate limit exceeded for user")
    }
}
```

This links the message to the current trace and includes all in-scope attributes (user ID, tenant, etc.).

## CaptureMessageAttributes

Capture a message with explicit attributes:

```go
traceway.CaptureMessageAttributes(
    "Payment processing delayed",
    map[string]string{
        "payment_id": paymentID,
        "delay_ms":   fmt.Sprintf("%d", delayMs),
        "provider":   "stripe",
    },
)
```

This creates a standalone message (no trace link) with the provided attributes.

## When to Use Messages vs Exceptions

Use **exceptions** (`CaptureException`) for actual errors — things that shouldn't happen and need stack traces for debugging.

Use **messages** (`CaptureMessage`) for notable events that aren't errors:

- Rate limit hits
- Feature flag activations
- Degraded service notifications
- Business rule violations
- Audit events

Both appear in the Issues list, but messages are marked distinctly from errors.
