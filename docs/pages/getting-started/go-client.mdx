# Go Client

The Traceway Go Client SDK provides automatic instrumentation for your Go applications. It captures HTTP transactions, exceptions, background tasks, and system metrics with minimal configuration.

## Getting Your Project Token

Before using the SDK, you need a project token from Traceway:

### 1. Register an Account

When you first access Traceway, the login page will redirect you to registration if no users exist. Create your account with:

- Email address
- Password

### 2. Create an Organization

After registration, you'll be prompted to create an organization. Organizations allow you to:

- Group related projects together
- Invite team members
- Manage access permissions

### 3. Create a Project

Within your organization, create a project for your application:

1. Click "New Project"
2. Enter a project name
3. Select your framework (e.g., "Go - Gin")
4. Copy the generated project token

The project token format is a UUID string like: `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`

## Installation

Install the Go client SDK:

```bash
go get github.com/tracewayapp/go-client
```

## Connection String Format

The SDK uses a connection string to configure the backend endpoint:

```
<project_token>@<backend_url>
```

Examples:
```
550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000@http://localhost:8082/api/report
your-token@https://traceway.example.com/api/report
```

## How Data Collection Works

The SDK uses a **ring buffer batching system** for efficient data collection:

1. **Collection**: Data is collected into a "frame" (transactions, exceptions, metrics)
2. **Batching**: Frames accumulate for a configurable interval (default: 5 seconds)
3. **Upload**: Completed frames are compressed (gzip) and sent to the backend
4. **Retry**: Failed uploads remain in the buffer for retry

This design minimizes network overhead and handles temporary connectivity issues gracefully.
